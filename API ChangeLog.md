ISAAC-Rest Changelog 

Any time a code change is made that impacts the API returned to callers, increment the value in API ChangeLog.md (here), and in RestSystemInfo

During development, we can increment this, so long as our client code (komet) is aware of the changes.

After we gain outside customers on the API, any change should be done by bumping the major version - and creating new rest paths (/rest/2/, /rest/write/2/)
If reverse compatibility is required to be maintained, then the rest/1 or rest/write/1 code must remain.

Until that happens, however - we follow the procedure of bumping the release version if it is an API change that won't break KOMET code - such as adding a new 
parameter.  However, any change that will break KOMET code - such as changing the operation of an existing method (which KOMET uses) - then the minor revision 
(and/or the major revision) should be bumped, to force a KOMET runtime breakage due to the incompatibility. 

Bug fixes should not be documented here, rather, than should be documented in the changelog file.

*** Don't forget to update the value in the class RestSystemInfo ***

* 2018/10/?? - 1.18.1
    * Adding measureSemanticConcept to RestFeatureNode to align with internal API
    * Renaming RestUntypedConnectorNode to RestConnectorNode
    * Moving 'children' from RestLogicNode down into RestConnectorNode, so that it properly aligns with the API, and allows / doesn't 
      allow children in the right parts of the model.  Literals and concept nodes will no longer have an API that shows the possibility of children.
      Only RestConnectorNode and RestTypedConnectorNode objects may have children.
    * Removed 'connectorTypeConceptDescription' from RestTypedConnectorNode, and it only provided duplicate information already available in 
      the RestIdentifiedObject 'connectorTypeConcept'.
    * Added 1/write/logicGraph/create for updating and creating logic graphs.
    * Added 1/validation/logicGraph/ for testing the validity of a logic graph, without storing the passed logic graph.
    * Added 'isConceptDefined' to RestTypedConnectorNode

* 2018/10/23 - 1.17.2
    * Adding nextPriorityLanguageCoordinate and modulePreferences to the RestLanguageCoordinate object.
    * Adding 1/validation/findFQN to the API for checking to see if a description would lead to a duplicate FQN prior to concept create
    * Adding system/descriptionStyle/{id} which allows you to determine at runtime, whether a terminology was loaded with the native
      (snomed style) descriptions, extended description style - which is how we histocially loaded external terminologies, or external,
      where we use description types directly from the external terminology.
    * Adding system/externalDescriptionTypes which gives you a list of the description types applicable to a terminology that uses the 
      external description type style, in a hierarchical form.
    * Adding "externalDescriptionTypeConcept" to RestConceptCreateData, which allows you to specify the description type for concept creation
      when working with a terminology that uses the external description style.  Updated documentation throughout the class to document
      the behavior when this parameter is utilized.
    * Added "externalDescriptionSemantic" to RestWriteResponseConceptCreate to handle the return when "externalDescriptionTypeConcept" is 
      used during create.
    * Added "descriptionStyle" to RestTerminologyConcept which is the return type of 1/system/terminologyTypes
    * Added 1/coordinate/editModule/{id} to return the appropriate (default) edit module for a particular terminology

* 2018/07/23 - 1.17.1
    * The coordinate APIs now allow the special keyword 'recurse' as a dialect, to properly support nested dialects like 
      en -> en-us -> en-nursing.  Other bugs and documentation issues around dialects were corrected.

* 2018/01/31 - 1.17.0
    * Moving over to the new OSEHRA ISAAC.  A few API updates to correspond.
    * Things that were previously called "sememe" are now called "semantic.
    * Sequence IDs are no longer part of the data model, and are not returned in any object.
    * Any API that took in a string identifier that accepted sequence IDs now only accepts nids (and/or UUIDs, as applicable)
    * RestTaxonomyCoordinate turned into RestManifoldCoordinate - this includes paths like restTaxonomyCoordinate/ becoming 
      restManifoldCoordinate/
    * RestSememeType becomes RestSemanticType
    * The parameter "descriptionType" became "descriptionTypes", and now accepts more than one descriptionType.  It also now accepts
      nids and uuids, in addition to the string constants it previously supported.
    * The parameter "extendedDescriptionTypeId" became extendedDescriptionTypes, and now accepts more than one type.  
    * The parameter value "sememe" for a search restriction type was changed to "semantic"
    * The parameter 'dynamicSememeColumns' was changed to 'dynamicSemanticColumns'
    * The parameter 'sememeMembership' was changed to 'semanticMembership' (both in query and return objects)
    * The workflow API has been disabled for now
    * The parameter 'nestedSememes' turned into 'nestedSemantics'
    * RestIdentifiedObject no longer carries a sequence id
    * All "Dynamic" transport objects had their naming changed from "Sememe" to "Semantic"
    * RestLiteralNodeInstant definition has been fixed, to now it passes a long and an int, rather than trying to serialize an Instant.
    * in RestWriteResponseConceptCreate fsnDescriptionSememe, preferredDescriptionSememe, extendedDescriptionTypeSememe,
      hasParentAssociationSememe, dialectSememes all changed to end with "Semantic" instead
    * in RestAssociationItemVersion, sourceSememe and targetSememe changed to end with "Semantic"
    * The path restSememeType/ changed to restSemanticType/
    * RestLiteralNodeFloat changed to RestLiteralNodeDouble
    * All parameters and variables named 'fsn' became 'fqn'.  Parameters will still accept the old values, but classes with variables such as 
      RestConceptCreateData, RestWriteResponseConceptCreate have variables that changed names to match.
